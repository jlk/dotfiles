This is my cheap and cheerful under-engineered dotfile setup.

Really, this is an experiment to see if I want to keep this stuff
accessible on a public repo - I'm doing more R&D on ephemeral systems
so being able to quickly bring in my bits would be nice.

Usage?
```
git clone https://github.com/jlk/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

## 2020 - the year of zsh!
So Apple decided to move to zsh as default shell on Catalina. I'd
tried zsh once or twice in the past, decied to give it a more serious
try at the end of 2019. Sorta liking the setup I have on my work
box, so adding that to my dotfiles setup so I can copy it out to
other places...

This is my cheap and cheerful under-engineered dotfile setup.

Really, this is an experiment to see if I want to keep this stuff
accessible on a public repo - I'm doing more R&D on ephemeral systems
so being able to quickly bring in my bits would be nice.

Usage?
```
git clone https://github.com/jlk/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
